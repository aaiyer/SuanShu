 * Given a probability space (Ω, F, P), a random process (or stochastic process) with state space X is
 * a collection of X-valued random variables indexed by a set T ("time").
 * That is, a stochastic process F is a collection {F<sub>t</sub>: t ∈ T}
 * where each F<sub>t</sub> is an X-valued random variable.
